<!--
    Each piece of html that you see with an opening bracket '<' and a closing bracket '>' is called a tag.
    Tags are the most important piece of HTML. The 'head' tag is filled with meta information about the web page,
    and it is also filled with html that is not rendered within the browser.
-->
<head>

    <!-- This particular tag tells our web browser that this site needs to be rendered using the 'UTF-8' character set -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- This tag is the title of our web page. Whatever you put within this tag will show up in the browser bar as the name of the web page. -->
    <title>Hello World</title>

<!-- This is our first closing tag. This is very similar to an opening tag, but instead of starting with a '<' it starts with a '</'. This tells the browser that the section, which had previously been started is now complete. -->
</head>

<!-- This tag is where the section of the site that the user sees is put. Everything within the body tag can be rendered to the user. -->
<body>
    <!-- This is our first piece of content that the user can see. It is a header with the level set to 1. -->
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <!-- You can render 6 different types of headers with the first being the most prominent with each becoming smaller. -->

    <!-- This is a paragraph of text, and it will be one of the most common HTML tags that you will use. -->

    <!-- This tag is a content divider, which will visibly separate sections of our page. -->
    <div>
        <!-- This tag allows us to how an unordered list of items. You can also use 'ol' to get an ordered list, which will then show numbers instead of bullets -->
        <ul>
            <!-- Within a ul or ol you can only have 'li' tags, which represent a list item. -->
            <li>
                <!-- Our last example on this page is for an anchor tag. This tag allows us to take our user to a different resource. -->

<!-- This is how every single page is finished on a web page. It needs to close both our body tag and html tag. -->
